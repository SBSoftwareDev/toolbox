# Toolbox
This repository holds snippets, notes, functions, and assets of mine that could be reused. My apologies for the aptly named *brain fart* that is the entire contents of this toolbox. 

In seriousness, **welcome**. Odds are, there are *very few* people who will come across these works, and read my thoughts. Prospective Employers, family and friends who I've asked to proofread, web-scraping bots, and myself make up most of the viewers I'm sure. If you're *not* in any of those categories, then I applaud you!
