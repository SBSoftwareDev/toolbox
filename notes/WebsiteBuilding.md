# Website Building Basics
There are *numerous* ways to build and configure a website, and there isn't a feasible way to cover them all in a concise manner. The goal of this note is to list basic configurations and tools for creating a website. 

One important thing to note, is that there is no *right* way or *best* way to make a website. Most of the time, there are simply *better* ways than others to achieve **your** goals. Are you making a blog website? Sure, you could use plain HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. There is nothing *wrong* with that, and you do have the ability to make a **good** website with those tools. This is where the term *better* comes in. You could use frameworks, packages, and assets to *expand* functionality, *decrease* work load, and get you to your goal *faster*.

## Critical Tools

**HTML** - HyperText Markup Language. This implements **content** and structure to your website.

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets. Implements **style** and design.

**JS** - JavaScript. Implements **functionality** and dynamicity to your website.

At this point, you could design a website, and deploy it to the internet with a website hosting service or cloud platform. (You *can* get by with just HTML, without CSS and JS, but... *please* don't do that.)
