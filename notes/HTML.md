# Basic HTML
Code with accessibility in mind, avoid using **Semantic** elements. 
- Semantic examples: ```<form>, <table>, <article>```
- Non-Semantic: ```<div>, <span>```


### Tags
```<h1>``` through ```<h6>``` are header tags.  
```<h1>``` is typically used once for titles, etc.  
```<p>``` is for paragraphs, nice separation of texblocks.  
```<hr>``` is for Horizontal Rule; adds separating line. Void element.  
```<br>``` is a Break element. Essentially a '/n'adds break in line. Void element.  
```<ul>``` | ```<li>``` | ```</ol>```      Unordered and Ordered lists. Can be nested.  

```<a>``` is the anchor element.  
Usage:  
```<a href="https://www.googlcom">Google</a```

```<img>``` is the image element. Void element.  
Usage:  
```<img src="url" alt="description" />``` 

- Use of 'alt' tag recommended for accessibility.
